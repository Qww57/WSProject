# WSProject
Web services project

When creating a new folder, before pushing into the common repository, you have to edit the gitgnore file. The /build, /dist and /nbrpoject should not be commited.

WS projects can be open as they are, if you have errors it's ok, you just have to clean and build the project and it should work.

Client project needs more work:
- open the client project,
- deploy the web service the client is linked to,
- create a new web service client in the client Project. You have to add the wsdl url link from the WS you have just been deploying
- clean and build the client
- if needed, import the packages suggested by openESB
